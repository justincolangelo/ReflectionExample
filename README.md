# Csharp Reflection Example

This program loads the CustomPrinter assembly by name (project reference included in the Example project allowing us to use it by name). 
It then iterates over the various methods and types and properties invoking some of the methods.

Open the solution in VS (This was created with VS2022 Community Edition and targets dotnet 7)
Build the solution to get the CustomPrinter assembly created or just run the program directly from VS.
